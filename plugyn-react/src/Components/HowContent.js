                                When you decide what you want to buy, you need to contact us over the Live Chat, Discord, Skype or E-mail. Please note that Live Chat is the fastest way to reach us.
                                You will need to tell us the server you want to buy yang on, how much and what payment method you wish to use. After we have checked if that amount of yang is in our stock, we can begin the trade process.
